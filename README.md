This project consists of two main components:
1. **Backend**: A server written in C, handling HTTPS and SMTP protocols to generate and send email read receipts.
2. **Extension**: A Chrome extension that allows users to track their emails by adding a tracking pixel before sending.

## Installation
1. Download the '''extension''' directory.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` directory.

## Usage
Email like you, normally, would. Just turn the receipts switch on before sending to get receipts.
